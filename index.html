                <p class="dropcap">The San Antonio team is focusing its efforts on a few core areas that build on long-running work done by the city and community to push themselves into the 21st century.</p>

                <p>Our engagements are more than apps -- some focus on building policies to sustain the civic hacking movement in the future or streamlining paper processes to make it easier for everyone to get things done.</p>

                <p>Our big-picture goal is to empower residents to own the city they live in, and to give residents the opportunity to give fearless feedback and fix community problems themselves. In partnership with the City of San Antonio, we also want to help the city continue its efforts to be more transparent and modernize its internal technology processes.</p>

                <h3>Brief on the State of the City</h3>

                <p class="dropcap">San Antonio is experiencing a growth in population size and an ongoing expansion of its boundaries through annexation surrounding land. A few key factors have led to an ever-growing need for city services, including an aging population, a deteriorating housing stock, and a struggling K-12 education system.</p>

                <p>The city is home to many large corporations, but a lack of skilled local talent has stunted the growth of its high-tech sector compared to its northern neighbor, Austin. A recent growth in local tech and small-business entrepreneurship, aided by incubators like Geekdom and San Antonio’s extremely low cost-of-living have opened the doors to increased local entrepreneurship.</p>

                <p>Internally, the city faces ongoing budget issues and continues to provide more services without sufficient increases in revenue. The longtime city manager, Sheryl Sculley, has consistently focused on improving customer service and uses customer satisfaction and service delivery efficiency as guiding metrics to set city strategy. This has allowed the city to maintain high quality services for residents, but has put a strain on staff and departments struggling to keep up with internal and external needs.</p>

                <p>The city wishes to use its engagement with Code for America as a template for providing better, more agile service delivery and continuing its focus on providing excellent customer service while saving valuable taxpayer dollars.</p>

                <h3>Focus Area: Neighborhood Revitalization</h3>

                <p class="dropcap">Our research in San Antonio made one thing very clear: San Antonio loves its neighborhoods. The way people interact with their neighborhoods has a huge impact on the neighborhood’s viability and the quality of life it provides for residents. Well-kept neighborhoods with vibrant social scenes are highly sought after; their property values increase, and businesses build up around them.</p>

                <p>We want to help residents come together and fix up their neighborhoods for themselves and the community at large.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="column">
                <h4>Homebase</h4>

                <h5>Background / Problem</h5>
                <p>San Antonio is 296 years old. It is home to many old neighborhoods in various states of revitalization. The homes and businesses in these neighborhoods face significant structural and visual problems, like crumbling foundations, leaking roofs and busted floors.</p>

                <p><em>Difficulty accessing grants and incentives</em>
                <br>There are many financial incentives available to property owners to improve their homes and offices/retail spaces. These grants have complex eligibility rules and are administered by a number of different organizations. It’s an opaque process that frustrates users.<p>

                <p><em>Confusing permit and regulation system</em>
                <br>The city has set down a number of regulations intended to improve the aesthetic of neighborhoods and ensure home improvements are done safely. These rules are poorly explained and almost impossible to navigate without expert help.</p>

                <h5>Research</h5>
                <p>We discovered our problem through explorations of the cities’ most challenged neighborhoods and discussions with San Antonio residents who face significant hurdles in improving the quality of their homes.</p>

                <p>Community partners, including SA2020, the Westside Development Corporation and others stressed the deep strain put on neighborhoods by crumbling homes. We discovered that structural issues like holes in walls and slipping foundations prevented homeowners from heating their homes in the winter and cooling them in the summer.</p>

                <p>Homeowners told us of the difficulty they had finding the right contractors and navigating the rules to perform these projects. Many don’t have access to the cash to complete all the repairs required on their homes, and leave much-needed repairs for another time.</p>

                <h5>Solution</h5>
                <p>Our project will make it easy to apply for permits, find grants grants, and pick the right contractors to work on home repair projects. We believe these three elements are the key to encouraging people to take the first step toward improving their homes.</p>

                <p>In the long term, we’d like to see our tool used to revitalize neighborhoods and make residents proud of the place they live.</p>

                <p><em>First steps</em>
                <br>We’re currently equipped to help homeowners get a few basic projects started by connecting them with the permits they need for the project. We’ve reformatted the current experience, which requires users to sort through cryptically-named PDF applications that arbitrarily group together different repairs. Our tool starts with the project -- users can select the repairs they want to complete, like adding a room -- and moves forward from there.</p>

                <p><em>Next steps</em>
                <br>We are exploring a few possible next steps, including integrating our app with the city’s backend to allow users to send their permit application with the click of a button, and to easily track its status online. We’re also investigating how to catalogue available grants and create a standard application process for them.</p>

                <p><em>Measuring success</em>
                <br>Our key metric to test our app against is improving the number of home repair permits applied for in the core downtown area. This area is home to challenged neighborhoods, some in states of deep disrepair.</p>

                <p>This metric was set forth by SA2020 as part of their Neighborhoods cause area, which is focused on improving the housing stock in San Antonio’s urban core and making the whole city a great place to live.</p>
