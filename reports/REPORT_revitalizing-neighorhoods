# Introduction

The San Antonio Code for America team is made up of three technology experts partnered with the city to create innovative solutions to government and resident problems. Our 11-month engagement (January through November) gives us an opportunity to embed in the city and do external research with residents. We are then charged with developing and deploying applications to solve local problems. 

## Our team

## About Code for America

Founded in 2009, Code for America (CfA) is a national nonprofit that partners with local governments and citizens to foster civic innovation. By working to reinvigorate civic participation, accelerate the civic startup marketplace, facilitate collaboration between government leaders, and build new tools that enhance and strengthen communities, CfA is helping governments solve old problems in new ways. CfA is working towards a government by the people, for the people, that works in the 21st Century.

## Our engagement with the city

While the private sector has evolved exponentially over the past decade, adopting new technologies and new ways of working, local governments haven't adapted at the same rate. Code for America partners with local governments who are working to catch up. The Fellowship program embeds community-minded engineers and designers inside local governments to collaborate with municipal leaders. Together they create and implement web applications and explore new approaches to local problems.

Our team is partnered with the City of San Antonio Information Technology Services Department. We have pulled on ITSD's extensive knowledge of internal systems and processes to help guide our research and development.

# Executive Summary

The Code for America team's long-term goal is to give residents the opportunity to improve their communities. In addition, through our partnership with the city we want to help local officials continue their efforts to be more transparent and modernize internal technology processes.

Our research revealed that the city faces issues with revitalizing its aging housing stock in the urban core, especially in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods. Key contributors to this problem are:

* A confusing permitting process and hard-to-understand land use rules
* A lack of centralized information for homeowners who want to undertake repairs themselves
* Insufficient information about finding capital to finance repairs

We've developed Homebase, a web application that seeks to address these problems by:

* Helping residents select an appropriate project to improve their home
* Guiding homeowners through the permit selection and application process step-by-step
* Explaining the basic land-use rules that apply to their project

Moving forward, we want to make the process even simpler by:

* Sorting through and recommending grants and financial incentives for applicable projects
* Connecting homeowners with skilled labor to complete renovations they can't perform on their own

## Timeline

* January: City research from our San Francisco HQ
* February: Extensive user research in San Antonio
* March: Brainstorming and prototyping with our partners in ITSD
* April: Set project area, build prototype application
* May: Improve application, in-depth research with Development Services Department
* June: Add features to application, continue user research
* July: Finish basic application, begin testing for eventual release
* August: Continue testing in the field, strategize with DSD on features
* September: Preliminary public launch for application
* October: Plan for future of application with ITSD, DSD
* November: Deliver application to city

## Key metrics

We're currently hoping to improve these metrics with our application.

### Number of renovation permits applied for within 410 loop annually

Baseline: 863 in 2010
Our goal: 1,000 in 2014

This metric was set forth by SA2020 as part of their Neighborhoods cause area, which is focused on improving the housing stock in San Antonio’s urban core and making the whole city a great place to live.

# Research

Research is foundation of our efforts in the City of San Antonio.

## Methodology

We focus on user-centered research to ensure we create applications that serve real problems. Our team interviewed hundreds of city employees, political leaders, community groups, local non-profits and average residents to get a full picture of what the city does well and where it needs help.

We began our research by meeting with leadership and customer-facing officials in dozens of city departments. We focused our questions on areas where the user experience breaks down. We spoke in-depth with the City Council representatives and their staff members to hear common concerns voiced by residents over the phone, at town hall meetings and at Council meetings.

We did on-the-ground research at a number of local nonprofits and NGOs, visiting and discussing the problems they face serving the community, interacting with each other and working with the city. Our research brought us to the San Antonio Food Bank, Haven for Hope, P16 Plus Council, Westside Development Corporation, San Antonio for Growth on the Eastside and more.

We also visited residents homes and interviewed residents who came in to city service centers to seek help or do business.

By approaching the resident experience from all sides, we tried to gain a full picture of how the city provides services and what services are ripe for intervention and improvement.

## Research insights

The city is providing a wide array of services to an increasingly dispersed population. A strained budget and cutback in distributed service centers have limited the day-to-day interaction residents have with city employees.

### Council and executive staff

Many city services

### Development Services Department

The centralization of building and land-use services at the One-Stop has provided efficiency and simplified the process of seeking out counsel on construction projects and related matters. However, some of the city's widely-dispersed population faces difficulty getting to the One-Stop, and information on the current website is hard to navigate and confusing. An upcoming redesign of the current website is a good step toward providing decentralized residents with information in their homes.

Much of the information finding process for average homeowners and subject-matter experts (contractors, architects, etc.) is still manual. The Development Services Department call center is an indispensable but limited resource. Some residents also seek information in person from the DSD counter staff at the One-Stop; staff members' deep institutional knowledge is essential for helping many

# Solution

We're working on Homebase, a tool that will make it easy to apply for permits, find grants grants, and pick the right contractors to work on home repair projects. We believe these three elements are the key to encouraging people to take the first step toward improving their homes.

In the long term, we’d like to see our tool used to revitalize neighborhoods and make residents proud of the place they live.

## Homebase: Overview

We’re currently equipped to help homeowners get a few basic projects started by connecting them with the permits they need for the project. 
We’ve reformatted the current experience, which is focused on how the city categorizes information internally. Our tool starts with the project -- users can select the repairs they want to complete, like adding a room -- and moves forward from there.

### Vision for the future

Moving forward, we're interested in integrating the 

We are exploring a few possible next steps, including integrating our app with the city’s backend to allow users to send their permit application with the click of a button, and to easily track its status online. We’re also investigating how to catalogue available grants and create a standard application process for them.
